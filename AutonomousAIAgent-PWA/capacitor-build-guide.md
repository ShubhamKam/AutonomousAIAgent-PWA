# Capacitor APK Build Guide

## Current Status âœ…
Your Autonomous AI Agent has been successfully prepared for APK conversion using Capacitor.

## What's Ready:
- âœ… Capacitor project initialized
- âœ… Android platform added  
- âœ… Web assets copied to Android project
- âœ… Configuration optimized for mobile

## APK Build Options:

### Option 1: Local Build (Android Studio Required)
```bash
# Open Android project in Android Studio
npx cap open android

# Or build from command line (requires Android SDK)
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Option 2: Online Build Services
1. **Ionic Appflow** (recommended)
   - Upload your project to Ionic Appflow
   - Cloud builds APK automatically
   - https://ionic.io/appflow

2. **GitHub Actions** (free)
   - Push code to GitHub
   - Use Android build workflow
   - Automated APK generation

### Option 3: Manual APK Generation
Your app is now ready as a Capacitor project. To build the APK:

1. Install Android Studio on a computer with Android SDK
2. Open the `android` folder in Android Studio
3. Build APK from "Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)"

## Project Structure:
```
AutonomousAIAgent-PWA/
â”œâ”€â”€ android/                 # Native Android project
â”œâ”€â”€ www/                     # Web assets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main app (fixed-final.html)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tools-integration.js # Tools system
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ proxy-server-fixed.js # API proxy
â”œâ”€â”€ capacitor.config.json   # Capacitor configuration
â””â”€â”€ build-apk.sh           # Build script
```

## App Configuration:
- **App ID**: com.autonomousai.agent
- **App Name**: AutonomousAIAgent
- **Bundle**: Android APK ready
- **Features**: Chat, Tools Integration, Bloomberg UI

## Next Steps:
1. Use Android Studio to build APK locally, OR
2. Upload to cloud build service, OR  
3. Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds

Your Autonomous AI Agent is now successfully converted to a Capacitor project and ready for APK generation! ðŸš€
